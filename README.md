# Summary
The [LoResMT 2019 Shared Task](https://github.com/loresmt/loresmt-2019) is a part of the [2nd Workshop on Technologies for MT of Low Resource Languages](https://www.loresmt.org/previous-workshops/loresmt-2019). 

# Introduction
In the first edition of the LoResMT Shared Task, we introduce new shared tasks that focus on the building of MT systems for lo-resourced languages. The task aims to encourage research on MT systems involving three low-resource language pairs:
```
Bhojpuri↔English
Magahi↔English
Sindhi↔English
Latvian↔English
```
